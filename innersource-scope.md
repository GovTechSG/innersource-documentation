# Innersource Scope

Innersourcing enables organisations to collaborate internally on software projects, share knowledge and skills, and promote reuse of code and solutions. In Govtech, we use two models of Innersource - *Project-initiated* and *Central Innersource*.

This document will explain the differences between these two models.

## Project-initiated Innersource

In the project-initiated model of Innersource, teams can start their own Innersource projects within their own project group in Gitlab without requiring central approval. The project owners have the freedom to choose which projects to innersource and can decide on the appropriate level of access control for their projects. Innersourced projects are discoverable in GitLab, where they can be searched and accessed by other members of the organization.

The main benefit of the project-initiated Innersource model is that it promotes permissionless agility and innovation within teams. Teams can experiment with new ideas, approaches, and technologies without the need for centralised approval. Teams can collaborate and share their work with others in the organization, leading to improved efficiency and productivity.

## Central Innersource

In the Central Innersource model, projects are hosted in the central Innersource group. In order to be centrally hosted, the project is required to meet certain criteria before they can adopted. The criteria for entry are defined by the central Innersource Working Group that oversees the Innersource initiative. The central Innersource team ensures that the adopted innersourced projects follow to Innersource best-practice, have common utility or widely used.

The main benefit of the Central Innersource model is that it promotes consistency and quality across projects. Projects that are innersourced have undergone a review process to ensure that they meet the baselines. This can save time and effort for teams that need to find and reuse existing solutions. In future, a core Innersource development team is planned to assist with maintenance and feature development for central projects.

## Choosing between Project-initiated and Central Innersource

We recommend that teams start with the project-initiated model of Innersource. This allows teams to experiment with Innersource in a controlled environment and develop their own processes and workflows. As contributions grow, teams can consider donating their projects to the Central Innersource program.

When deciding whether to use Project-initiated or Central Innersource, teams should consider the following factors:

* **Control:** Project-initiated Innersource provides teams with more control and ownership over their projects, while Central Innersource requires teams to adhere to a central set of criteria.
* **Agility:** Project-initiated Innersource promotes permissionless agility and publishing, while Central Innersource promotes consistency, utility and quality.
* **Discoverability:** Projects in Project-initiated Innersource are discoverable in GitLab under the project owner's group, search and topics, while projects in Central Innersource are discoverable under the central group.
