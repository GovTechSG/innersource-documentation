# Project and Community Innersource

Innersourcing enables organisations to collaborate internally on software projects, share knowledge and skills, and promote reuse of code and solutions. In Govtech, we use two models of Innersource - *Project* and *Community Innersource*.

This document will explain the differences between these two models.

## Project Innersource

In the project-initiated model of Innersource, teams can start their own Innersource projects within their own project group in Gitlab without requiring central approval. The project owners have the freedom to choose which projects to innersource and can decide on the appropriate level of access control for their projects. Innersourced projects are discoverable in GitLab, where they can be searched and accessed by other members of the organization.

The main benefit of the project-initiated Innersource model is that it promotes permissionless agility and innovation within teams. Teams can experiment with new ideas, approaches, and technologies without the need for centralised approval or governance. Teams can collaborate and share their work with others in the organization, leading to improved efficiency and productivity.

## Community Innersource

In the Community Innersource model, projects are hosted in the central Innersource group in SHIP Gitlab. In order to be centrally hosted, the project is required to meet certain criteria before being adopted. The criteria for entry are currently being defined by the Innersource Working Group that oversees the Innersource initiative (come join us if you are interested to help). The Innersource team ensures that the adopted innersourced projects follow to Innersource best-practice, have common utility or are widely used.

The main benefit of the Community Innersource model is that it promotes consistency and quality across projects. Projects that are innersourced have undergone a review process to ensure that they meet the baselines. This can save time and effort for teams that need to find and reuse existing solutions. In future, a core Innersource development team is planned to assist with maintenance and feature development for central projects.

## Choosing between Project and Community Innersource

We recommend that teams start with the project-initiated model of Innersource. This allows teams to experiment with Innersource in a controlled environment and develop their own processes and workflows. As contributions grow, teams can consider donating their projects to the Community Innersource program.

For code that is not aligned with a project, team or has general utility (such as IaC, templates, code libraries, helper utilities, etc), then the Community Innersource group can be a better starting point. Please reach out to the Innersource working group to discuss.

When deciding whether to use Project or Community Innersource, teams should consider the following factors:

* **Control:** Project Innersource provides teams with more control and ownership over their projects, while Community Innersource requires teams to adhere to a central set of criteria.
* **Agility:** Project Innersource allows permissionless agility and publishing, while Community Innersource promotes consistency, utility and quality.
* **Discoverability:** Projects in Project Innersource are discoverable in GitLab under the project owner's group, search and topics, while projects in Community Innersource are discoverable under the central group.
